            <p>Hey everyone! My name is Cole Etter and I'm from Fort Collins, Colorado. I'm currently going to school at BYUI to obtain a Bachelor's in Business Management. I will be graduating soon but I decided that I wanted to also get a Bachelor's in Software Development so I started taking classes through BYU Pathways. I love rock climbing, hiking, and playing board games with my wife!</p>

            <p>There's a lot of potatoes for some reason. Like a lot. I'm not originally from Idaho so I'm not used to all of the potatoes. I'm from Colorado and we've got a lot of farms and stuff but seriously, why so many potatoes. They put potatoes on everything here. Don't get me wrong, I like potatoes, I just made some baked potatoes for dinner last night but we don't need that on our pizza. Please stop.</p>
