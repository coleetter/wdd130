            <p>Hey everyone! My name is Cole Etter and I'm from Fort Collins, Colorado. I'm currently going to school at BYUI to obtain a Bachelor's in Business Management. I will be graduating soon but I decided that I wanted to also get a Bachelor's in Software Development so I started taking classes through BYU Pathways. I love rock climbing, hiking, and playing board games with my wife!</p>
