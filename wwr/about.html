                    <p>At Mountain Surge Rafting, our mission is to send people down rivers and hopefully bring them back! Because you know, there's a lot of water in the rivers and it can get surprisingly difficult to get people back on land. And always remember our motto: "Once you've reached Mexico, you're no longer in the US so there's nothing we can really do for you at that point."</p>

                <section>
                    <p>As the owners of a company, we’re often asked, “How did you guys get started?”, “How did you come up with the idea to start a rafting company?”, "Is this safe?”, and "Are you sure my legs are supposed to go through there?" as if I don't know how a life vest works. I KNOW HOW THEY WORK SAMANTHUH! So here is our story.</p>
                    <p>One day, me and my roommates were watching MTV, (like the classic MTV, not that trashy new stuff) and we saw some people rafting. We thought it looked kinda dope, so we decided to try start a company that takes other people rafting. To be honest, we don't really know how it works though, it's just a lot of guess work. You'll probably know more about rafting than we do.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, we figured we should probably have one of our boys go rafting at least once or twice before taking others rafting. So that's what we did.</p>

                    <p>We were all too scared to try it out though, so we decided to send our test-dummy out there. He's not a real test-dummy though. He's just another one of our boys that usually has no idea what's going on so it's pretty easy to convince him to do things that the rest of us don't want to do. His name is Tony.</p>
                    <p>Tony seemed to enjoy it. At least we think. He was asleep for the first half (probably due to the cough syrup we slipped him so we could get him on the river without him noticing). The other half we assume was full of joyful screams and laughter. We didn't really know when to pull him out though. Or how. So we just left him. But he made his way back home a month later!</p>
                    <p>So after Tony made it back, we figured it was a feasible plan and we started sending people down rivers, occasionally bringing them back, and making dough!</p>
